# Web Application of Healthy Pets

## Abstract
The application our team would make is called healthy pets. The basic blocks of the application include input, search, output and FAQs page, which represent 4 functions of the application. For the input block, the user basically could type the pet information into the database for recording. The search block is made for users to get the information out of the database by type the keywords such as nickname, species, age. After user types in, the web server will respond and give an output page, which essentially shows the result of the searching or inputting. The FAQs page block is made for users to quickly get the direction to experience an application, and it will effectively improve the satisfaction of the user.
